HEX - the HTML & executable extractor
=====================================

A documentation of how to use `hex` is available at

https://itmm.github.io/using-hex/

`hex` transforms documents that contain source code and documentation
into a HTML slide show and extracts the source code. And of course it
is written with `hex`.

You can view the slide show that generates `hex` at

I love to get comments from users to know where to direct further
development.

The most interesting question is: How much code should be presented
on one slide? If it is too much, it will become confusing. If the amount
is too small, too many slides will be needed and the distribution over
multiple slides is also confusing. The current limits are only
guesswork. It would be great, if there is a more systematic approach.
